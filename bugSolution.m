The solution involves proper memory management techniques using ARC:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    // Use `self.myString` to manage object lifetime. If we set it multiple times, ARC releases the previous string.
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}

- (void)someOtherMethodWithBlock:(void (^)(void))aBlock {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        if (weakSelf) {
            // Use weakSelf to safely access self within a block; avoids potential crashes if self is deallocated before block execution
            NSLog(@"My String: %@
", weakSelf.myString);
        }
    });
}
@end
```
This revised code leverages ARC's automatic memory management.  The use of `__weak` in `someOtherMethodWithBlock` prevents retain cycles and potential crashes if `self` deallocates before the block executes.
