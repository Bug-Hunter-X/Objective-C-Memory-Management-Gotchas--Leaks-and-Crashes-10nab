In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its modern counterpart, Automatic Reference Counting or ARC).  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new `NSString` object. If you're not carefully managing the `myString` property (releasing the old string before assigning a new one), you'll end up with memory leaks. This isn't immediately obvious, especially in larger applications.  Another subtle error can occur when using blocks; if you capture `self` inside the block and the block is executed after the object is deallocated, you'll get a crash.
